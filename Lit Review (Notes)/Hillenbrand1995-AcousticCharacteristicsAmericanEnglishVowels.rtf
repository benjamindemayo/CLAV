\f0\fs24 \cf0 Starts by calling back to Peterson and Barney (1952), showing a strong relationship between the intended vowel and the formant frequency pattern, but noting there was considerable formant frequency variability from one speaker to the next, with a substantial degree of overlap in the formant frequency patterns among adjacent vowels.\
\
There is now evidence that dynamic properties such as vowel duration and spectral change play an important role in vowel perception. This study attempts to address the Peterson and Barney (1952) limitations.}
