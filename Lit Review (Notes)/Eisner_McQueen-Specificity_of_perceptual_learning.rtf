\f0\fs24 \cf0 Not only can one phoneme have different acoustic realizations, but one acoustic pattern can elicit different phonemic percepts. The study asks whether talker-specific adjustments are made in the speech recognition system in response to unusual productions of speech sounds, and if so, how detailed those adjustments are.\

Findings by Nygaard, Sommers, and Pisoni (1994) suggest that once a listener has adjusted to the idiosyncrasies of a particular talker\'92s utterances, the result of this process is stored and will be used again to facilitate perception when this voice is encountered at a later point \'97 a conclusion that is in line with the recurrent observation that listeners encode details of talkers\'92 voices in long-term memory.}
